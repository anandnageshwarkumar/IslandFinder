# IslandFinder Program to find Islands in a 2d array of numbers between 0 -9 Island: 4 or more matching numbers, horizontally or vertically adjacent. Zero (0): Zero is a special number that acts as wild card, meaning it substitutes for other numbers, but It cannot form its own island. Input: a n x m array of int (0 – 9) (generate random input or read from file), 6 < n < 13, 6 < m < 13 Output: number of islands, information about island should include the size, forming number and their positions.

For the above example, output may look like, 
Number of Islands: 4
Island 1 - Size 4, formed by: 1 location:  1, 2, 9, 10
Island 2 – Size 4, formed by: 1 location: 16, 24, 32, 40 
Island 3 – Size 5, formed by: 2 location: 44, 45, 46, 53, 54
Island 4 – Size 4, formed by: 4 location: 59, 60, 61, 53
